# Easter Egg Collector

This project demonstrates game logic through the use of javascript and JQuery. 

There are four Easter Eggs displayed at the bottom of the page and the player is shown a random number between 19-120 in the center of the page. When the player clicks on an egg, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score (this amount is hidden until the player clicks on the egg and is between 1-12). Once clicked, the player's total score updates at the bottom of the page. The object of the game is to match the random number shown at the start of the game. 

The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game. The player loses if their score goes above the random number. The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all of the eggs will have four new hidden values and the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.
